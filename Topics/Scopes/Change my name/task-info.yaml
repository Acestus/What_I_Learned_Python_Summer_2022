  message: <html>When we are changing the name variable in change_name(), Python interpreter
    considers it to be defined inside the function body (because, as per the LEGB
    rule, it first looks for a variable inside the local scope) and therefore local.
    Local variables canâ€™t be changed outside the function body. To change the name
    variable outside the function body, we must use the keyword global.</html>
